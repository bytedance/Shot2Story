We are excited to release a new video-text benchmark for multi-shot video understanding. This release contains a 20k version of our dataset. It includes detailed long summaries for 20k videos and shot captions for 80k video shots.

ðŸŒŸ **_More Annotations are on the Way!_** ðŸŒŸ

**For video data downloading, please have a look at [this issue](https://github.com/bytedance/Shot2Story/issues/5).**


## Annotation Format <a name="annotation-format"></a>
Our 134k multi-shot videos come with detailed textual descriptions, consisting of 43k human annotation and 90k GPTV generation and covering over 548k video shots. The different files under `data/annotations/`:
- **20k_{train/test/val}.json** 20k-version release. We keep using testing/validation split in 134k version.
- **90k_gptv_train.json** 90k subset from 134k release, of which the text summaries are generated by GPTV with long visual tokens.
- **43k_human_train.json** 43k subset from 134k release, of which the text summaries are produced and rectified by human annotators, paired with 188k human-annotated video shot captions and narration captions.
- **134k_full_train.json** 134k full release, covering 548k video shots.


Annotations are in JSON format, with each video as a JSON object:

- **video, image_id, nvid:** Video file name.
- **id:** Unique video ID.
- **whole_caption:** Video summary.
- **whole_ASR:** Full-video ASR from [Whisper Large-v2](https://github.com/openai/whisper).
- **video_names:** Array of video shot names.
- **audio_captions:** Array of narration captions per shot.
- **captions:** Array of video captions per shot.
- **ASR:** Array of ASR outputs from [Whisper Large-v2](https://github.com/openai/whisper) per shot.

Example:

```json
[
    {
    "video": "video_name.mp4",
    "image_id": "video_name.mp4",
    "id": 0,
    "whole_caption": "summary",
    "whole_ASR": "ASR output",
    "nvid": "video_name.mp4",
    "video_names": ["shot_name1.mp4", "shot_name2.mp4"],
    "audio_captions": ["narration1", "narration2"],
    "captions": ["caption1", "caption2"],
    "ASR": ["ASR shot1", "ASR shot2"]
    },
    ...
]
```
