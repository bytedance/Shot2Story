We are excited to release a new video-text benchmark for multi-shot video understanding. This release contains a 20k version of our dataset. It includes detailed long summaries for 20k videos and shot captions for 80k video shots.

ðŸŒŸ **_More Annotations are on the Way!_** ðŸŒŸ


## Annotation Format <a name="annotation-format"></a>

Our annotations are in JSON format, with each video as a JSON object:

- **video, image_id, nvid:** Video file name.
- **id:** Unique video ID.
- **whole_caption:** Video summary.
- **whole_ASR:** Full-video ASR from [Whisper Large-v2](https://github.com/openai/whisper).
- **video_names:** Array of video shot names.
- **audio_captions:** Array of narration captions per shot.
- **captions:** Array of video captions per shot.
- **ASR:** Array of ASR outputs from [Whisper Large-v2](https://github.com/openai/whisper) per shot.

Example:

```json
[
    {
    "video": "video_name.mp4",
    "image_id": "video_name.mp4",
    "id": 0,
    "whole_caption": "summary",
    "whole_ASR": "ASR output",
    "nvid": "video_name.mp4",
    "video_names": ["shot_name1.mp4", "shot_name2.mp4"],
    "audio_captions": ["narration1", "narration2"],
    "captions": ["caption1", "caption2"],
    "ASR": ["ASR shot1", "ASR shot2"]
    },
    ...
]
```
