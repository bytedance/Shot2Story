We are excited to release a new video-text benchmark for multi-shot video understanding. This release contains a 134k version of our dataset. It includes detailed long summaries (human annotated + GPTV generated) for 134k videos and shot captions (human annotated) for 188k video shots. Additionally, we annotate question-answering pairs for benchmarking multi-shot video understanding.


## Annotation Format <a name="annotation-format"></a>
Our 134k multi-shot videos come with detailed textual descriptions, consisting of 43k human annotation and 90k GPTV generation and covering over 548k video shots. The different files under `data/annotations/`:

- **20k_{train/test/val}.json** 20k-version release. We keep using testing/validation split in 134k version.
- **90k_gptv_train.json** 90k subset from 134k release, of which the text summaries are generated by GPTV with long visual tokens.
- **43k_human_train.json** 43k subset from 134k release, of which the text summaries are produced and rectified by human annotators, paired with 188k human-annotated video shot captions and narration captions.
- **134k_full_train.json** 134k full release, covering 548k video shots.
- **{testing/val}_qa.json** multi-shot question-asnwering pair by manual annotation and verification. We collate and annotate QA pairs from temporal-related, holistic understanding and audio-related aspects on testing and validation videos for benchmarking.
- **20k_meta.csv** meta data of our original released 20k multi-shot videos, including categories, original YouTube ID and starting-ending timestamps of the cared multi-shot video.
- **134k_meta.csv** meta data of our latest released 134k multi-shot videos, including categories, original YouTube ID and starting-ending timestamps of the cared multi-shot video.
- **114k_meta.csv** meta data of the update 114k multi-shot videos, in case you have the previous 20k version, including categories, original YouTube ID and starting-ending timestamps of the cared multi-shot video.



Annotations are in JSON format, with each video as a JSON object:

- **video, image_id, nvid:** Video file name.
- **id:** Unique video ID.
- **whole_caption:** Video summary.
- **whole_ASR:** Full-video ASR from [Whisper Large-v2](https://github.com/openai/whisper).
- **video_names:** Array of video shot names.
- **audio_captions:** Array of narration captions per shot.
- **captions:** Array of video captions per shot.
- **ASR:** Array of ASR outputs from [Whisper Large-v2](https://github.com/openai/whisper) per shot.

Example:

```json
[
    {
    "video": "video_name.mp4",
    "image_id": "video_name.mp4",
    "id": 0,
    "whole_caption": "summary",
    "whole_ASR": "ASR output",
    "nvid": "video_name.mp4",
    "video_names": ["shot_name1.mp4", "shot_name2.mp4"],
    "audio_captions": ["narration1", "narration2"],
    "captions": ["caption1", "caption2"],
    "ASR": ["ASR shot1", "ASR shot2"]
    },
    ...
]
```

## Videos Downloading <a name="videos-downloading"></a>

We provide cached multi-shot videos [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!Ap3OKt6-X52NgXoG4-64N9WZDenS?e=oIHfkZ) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/mhan/shot2story-videos). It takes around 160GB of disk space and needs to extract video shots on your own.

Or, you can download on your own:

1. **Access Information:** YouTube video ID, chapter ID, and start-end timestamps from HD-VILA-100M are in [./data/annotations](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mhan/shot2story/tree/main)/`134k_meta.csv`, or you can download the update videos in [./data/annotations](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mhan/shot2story/tree/main)/`114k_meta.csv`.
2. **Download Scripts:** Use our Python scripts in `./data/scripts/download_videos.py` to download videos. Ensure you have necessary permissions.
3. **Video Preparation:** Use our code in `./data/scripts/process_videos.py` to prepare video clips and single-shot videos. As a prerequisite, please run `data/scripts/get_existing_data.py` to have all the downloaded raw videos for processing.
